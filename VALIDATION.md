# Validation

Every gate currently active in this repository, with its exact scope,
followed by the evidence record of each implemented capability.

## Local gates

| Gate | Command | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Lint | `ruff check .` | all Python under `src/`, `tools/`, and `tests/` |
| Format | `ruff format --check .` | same scope |
| Typing | `mypy --strict src tools tests` | zero errors, strict mode |
| Tests + coverage | `pytest -q --cov=src --cov=tools --cov-branch --cov-fail-under=100` | 100 % statement and branch coverage of `src/` and `tools/` |
| Domain manifest | `python3 tools/validate_reactor_domain.py reactor-domain.json` | schema, registry version/digest, exact configuration set, capability inventory shape and ceiling rule, safety boundary |
| Studio descriptor | `python3 tools/derive_studio_descriptor.py --check` | committed descriptor byte-identical to a fresh derivation |
| Capability inventory | `python3 tools/generate_capability_inventory.py --check` | committed inventory byte-identical to a fresh generation |
| Licensing | `reuse lint` | REUSE 3.x compliance of the full tree |
| Workflow lint | `actionlint` | all files under `.github/workflows/` |
| Workflow modularity | `python3 tools/audit_workflows.py` | distributed workflow inventory: single ownership per job, coordinator/gate contract, action pinning, size ceilings |
| Documentation | `python3 tools/preflight.py --only docs` | UTF-8 readability and relative-link integrity of every Markdown file |
| Orchestrated | `python3 tools/preflight.py` | fail-closed run of all gates above |

## Workflow gates

Definitions are present in-repository; they run on the hosted platform
only once a remote exists under separate owner authority.

The hosted surface is modular: `ci.yml` is a coordinator that carries
only trigger policy, two reusable-workflow calls, and one stable
fail-closed `gate` job aggregating every category (failure,
cancellation, and unexpected skips all fail the gate). Every job is
declared and owned exactly once in the versioned inventory
`.github/workflow-inventory.json`, which the workflow-modularity guard
verifies locally and in hosted CI.

| Workflow | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ci.yml` | coordinator and stable required gate |
| `reusable-static-policy.yml` | lint, format, typing, domain policy, workflow guard |
| `reusable-tests.yml` | tests with complete statement and branch coverage |
| `pre-commit.yml` | exact pre-commit parity |
| `codeql.yml` | Python code scanning |
| `security-audit.yml` | secrets, dependency, licence, and workflow policy |
| `docs.yml` | strict documentation and link validation, no deployment |
| `sbom.yml` | reproducible dependency inventory, no release |
| `scorecard.yml` | read-only supply-chain analysis |

## Shared ecosystem gate

From the monorepo root:

```bash
python3 agentic-shared/scripts/repository_tier0_scaffold_audit.py \
  03_CODE/SCPN-MIF-MAGLIF-CORE --json
```

proves the Tier-0 local-scaffold machine profile (required and forbidden
paths, Git/remote boundary, workflow pins and permissions, badge non-claims,
JSON integrity, defensive ignore rules).

## Device configuration model

Evidence record of the `device_configuration_model` capability
(`computational_prototype`; design record: `docs/adr/0002-device-configuration-model.md`).

What is exercised, all under the 100 % statement-and-branch coverage gate:

- Validated frozen parameter objects (`Liner`, `ThreeStageDrive`,
  `DeviceConfiguration`) rejecting non-finite values, non-positive
  extents, a wall at or beyond the liner radius, and missing
  premagnetisation or preheat (the defining MagLIF stages; Slutz et
  al., Phys. Plasmas 17 (2010) 056303) — every rejection branch is
  tested.
- The liner aspect ratio `AR = R / dR` as a documented derived
  quantity, with an advisory finding outside the documented `[3, 9]`
  design window (baseline AR = 6), reported and never clamped.
- Canonical serialisation (sorted keys, NaN/infinity rejected on both
  emit and parse), SHA-256 digest identity, and a strict round-trip
  parser that refuses unknown fields.
- A data-only pin equality check binding the model to the SPO reactor
  registry version and digest declared in `reactor-domain.json`.

Bounded claims — what is NOT claimed:

- No parameter set describes, approximates, or validates any real
  machine; every exercised parameter set is a synthetic test fixture.
- The estimates are advisory regime checks, not implosion, stability,
  or yield results; no benchmark, dataset, solver, controller, or
  experimental correlation exists in this repository.

## Diagnostic and clock semantics

Evidence record of the `diagnostic_clock_semantics` capability
(`computational_prototype`; design record: `docs/adr/0003-diagnostic-clock-semantics.md`).

What is exercised, all under the 100 % statement-and-branch coverage gate:

- Validated frozen declaration objects (`ClockModel`,
  `DiagnosticChannelPlan`, `DeferredCandidate`, `DiagnosticPlan`)
  rejecting catalogue misalignment: inapplicable candidates,
  inadmissible carriers, evidence-vocabulary mismatches, incompatible
  clock kinds, Nyquist violations, unresolvable event-timing bounds,
  and incomplete candidate coverage — every rejection branch is tested.
- A data-only pin (`ObservabilityBinding`) to the SPO
  observability-profile catalogue release `1.0.0`
  (`d70c0de696534e5a77066ef8420cf7ca17bc4d7321984b0ac83523dbc1dce609`),
  bound in turn to reactor registry `1.0.0`; a plan pinned to any other
  release is rejected.
- A reference plan mirroring canonical practice with synthetic
  declarations: liner-arrival train, compression trajectory, liner-asymmetry set, synthetic oscillator, each bound to its clock domain.
- Documented advisory band and timing checks with their sources stated
  in the code: liner-asymmetry bands of 1–1000 MHz and sub-ns arrival timing (Slutz 2010); findings are reported, never clamped.
- Canonical serialisation (sorted keys, NaN/infinity rejected on both
  emit and parse), SHA-256 digest identity, and a strict round-trip
  parser that refuses unknown fields.

Bounded claims — what is NOT claimed:

- No channel describes a real diagnostic, measurement, or facility;
  every plan is a synthetic declaration of HOW evidence slots would be
  bound, marked `synthetic=True` by hard invariant.
- No SPO semantic-profile ingress is declared; the profile registry
  `ingress_state` for this device family remains `not_declared`, and
  no adapter, producer, or handoff exists in this repository.

### Portable plan envelope

The `diagnostic_clock_semantics` capability additionally exercises a
producer-owned portable envelope
(`src/scpn_mif_maglif_core/plan_envelope.py`,
`scpn.reactor-diagnostic-plan-envelope.v1` version `1.0.0`): one
canonically serialised object carrying the exact project identity and
owned configurations, the capability and its maturity, the
synthetic/review-only/non-actuating statements, both SPO registry pins,
the SHA-256 digest of the inner canonical plan, the producer revision,
and fixed no-observation/no-control non-claims. The committed immutable
fixture (`tests/data/plan_envelope_fixture.json`, byte hash pinned in
the tests) is verified together with positive, tamper, wrong-project,
wrong-configuration, registry-drift, duplicate-member, and non-finite
rejection paths, all under the 100 % coverage gate. The envelope claims
nothing beyond the enveloped synthetic declaration.

### Typed frames, clock relations, and acquisition geometry

The deepened model adds typed reference frames (per-repository allowed
`FrameKind` subset; every noncyclic `coordinate_frame` binding must
reference a declared frame), clock synchronisation relations
(synthetic offset/uncertainty BOUNDS between declared non-simulation
clocks with an explicit method statement — no correlation evidence is
claimed and no clock is mapped to physical wall time), and per-channel
acquisition windows and element counts with device-cited advisory
scales. Both decoders are hardened per the SPO intake architecture:
recursive exact-key refusal in every nested entry, duplicate-member
refusal, and byte-canonical refusal (a document that is not exactly
canonical bytes is rejected). The envelope is `1.1.0`, adding
`manifest_sha256` — the SHA-256 of the committed canonical
`reactor-domain.json` — verified in tests against the committed file.
All declarations remain synthetic; nothing here observes or controls
anything.

### Signal inventories, frame transformations, and clock topology

The depth slice (envelope `1.2.0`; a `1.1.0` document is refused by the
`1.2.0` codec and vice versa — no defaults, no cross-version coercion;
`1.1.0` remains historical custody at the consumer) adds three typed
declaration surfaces, every branch under the 100 % statement-and-branch
gate:

- A per-channel **signal inventory** (`SignalDeclaration`: identifier,
  quantity, unit, role, description). Hard rules: non-empty, unique and
  sorted; exactly one `carrier`; a `timing_marker` in `"s"` exactly for
  event-relative channels and forbidden otherwise; numerical-only
  channels declare a single `phase`/`rad` carrier. Quantity and unit are
  declared tokens — no SI or UCUM validation is performed or claimed —
  and no declaration creates or overrides a candidate, carrier,
  observation, or phase: the candidate profile stays authoritative. An
  advisory flags a multi-element cyclic array without an amplitude
  signal.
- **Frame transformations** (`FrameTransformation`): the frame kinds this
  repository may declare admit no transformation pair, so the
  transformation tuple must be empty and a second frame — which could
  never be connected — is refused. The model, its admissibility table
  and its declaration-only semantics (`evidence_claimed` always `False`)
  are shared with the portfolio.
- A **clock topology** (`ClockDomain`, `ClockTopology`): every physical
  clock in exactly one domain, the simulation clock in none; a domain
  holding a facility clock is rooted there, otherwise at its shot-event
  epoch; every non-root member declares a relation to its root; every
  non-reference root declares a relation to the reference root (star);
  relations must not form a cycle. The reference plan declares one
  domain (`clk_facility` root, `clk_shot` member); multi-domain rules
  are exercised by test-constructed plans. Scopes are declarations;
  `mapping_state` stays `unmapped`.

## Level-0 device physics

Evidence record of the `level0_device_physics` capability
(`computational_prototype`; design record: `docs/adr/0005-level0-device-physics.md`).

What is exercised, all under the 100 % statement-and-branch coverage gate:

- **The three stages, expressed mechanically.** The azimuthal field the
  axial current puts at the liner surface, `mu0 I / 2 pi r`, and its
  magnetic pressure; the liner's mass, measured from the outside in
  because that is how this family declares a liner, and its implosion
  kinetic energy at a declared velocity; and the preheat energy deposited
  divided by the fuel volume the bore encloses. The field is checked to
  fall as one over the radius, not merely to be computed.
- **Stagnation.** Axial flux conservation `B_z (r_0/r)^2` and adiabatic
  compression `(r_0/r)^(2(gamma-1))`, both ideal limits recorded as upper
  bounds. The non-integer power goes through the shared library's
  deterministic kernel and a test asserts the two are the same call.
- Every refusal branch: a current, radius, field, wall, length or density
  that is zero, negative, infinite or not-a-number; a wall that leaves no
  bore; a convergence ratio that does not converge, checked on **all
  three** compression relations; and an adiabatic index that would not
  heat.
- Canonical serialisation, digest identity and stability, digest movement
  when the declared convergence moves, and the two halves of the record
  agreeing on the radius the compression starts from.

Anchoring — every configuration field is a printed value:

- **Printed** by the filed chapter SAND2021-3239B: the liner is 10 mm
  tall, 5 mm in outer diameter and 0.5 mm in wall; the first integrated
  experiment used a 10 T axial field, 0.5 kJ of deposited preheat and
  18 MA of peak load current. All six reach the composed record, and the
  test reads them out of it.
- The aspect ratio those two printed liner numbers give is **exactly
  5.0**, asserted as an equality: the outer radius is half the printed
  diameter and both operands and the quotient are exactly representable.
- **Printed as a range, not a value**: the peak implosion velocity, 70 to
  100 kilometres per second. A value is declared from inside it and a
  separate test asserts it is inside.
- **Declared, and said to be declared**: the liner material density, the
  convergence ratio and the adiabatic index.
- **The filed source is a RELATED public chapter**, not the cited
  Phys. Plasmas 17 (2010) 056303, which is behind a subscription and is
  not on file. Nothing here implies the cited paper was read.

Bounded claims — what is NOT claimed:

- No equation of motion, equation of state or transport equation is
  solved.
- The compressed axial field is the perfect-conductor limit and the
  compressed temperature the loss-free limit; both are upper bounds, never
  predictions.
- The drive field is the vacuum field of an axial current at the liner
  surface. No circuit, no current distribution and no instability is
  modelled.
- No yield, gain, reactivity, confinement or breakeven statement is made,
  and no value describes or validates a real machine.
